# Space Odyssey — Interactive Frontend

## Project Overview
Space Odyssey is a front-end educational site about space missions. This version adds JavaScript interactivity: form validation, search & filters, CRUD for missions, favorites, and local persistence — all running entirely on the client (no backend).

## Key Features
- Form validation (required fields, email format, inline error messages)
- Add / Edit / Delete missions (modal form + DOM updates)
- Responsive mission cards (auto-generated from JS array)
- Advanced search & filters (name, agency, objective, year, combined filters)
- Favorites system with a dedicated Favorites view
- Client-side persistence using `localStorage`
- Smooth UI interactions and event-driven updates (no page reloads)

## Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (responsive)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
- `localStorage` for persistence

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd space-odyssey-Interactive
